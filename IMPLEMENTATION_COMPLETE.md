# Platform Enhancements Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive multi-tenant SaaS platform features to enable Platform Owners to manage SaaS Creators, who in turn manage their subscribers. All core API endpoints have been implemented and tested.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ 1. Platform Owner Role (100% Complete - Backend)

**Database Changes:**
- Added `role` field to User model with values: `creator` (default) or `platform_owner`
- First user to register automatically becomes Platform Owner

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/platform/creators` - Lists all SaaS creators with statistics
  - Pagination support (page, limit)
  - Returns: business info, product counts, subscriber counts, revenue

**Features:**
- Role-based access control enforced on all Platform Owner endpoints
- Session includes user role for authorization checks
- Platform Owners can view analytics for any creator

---

### ✅ 2. API Key Management (100% Complete - Backend)

**Database Schema:**
- New `ApiKey` table with fields:
  - `key` (SHA-256 hashed for security)
  - `keyPrefix` (first 11 chars for display: "sk_12345678")
  - `permissions` (array of permission strings)
  - `isActive`, `expiresAt`, `lastUsedAt`

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/saas/api-keys` - Generate new API key
  - Returns full key only once (on creation)
  - Supports custom permissions and expiration
- `GET /api/saas/api-keys` - List user's API keys
  - Never shows full keys (security)
- `PATCH /api/saas/api-keys/[id]` - Update API key
  - Can activate/deactivate or rename
- `DELETE /api/saas/api-keys/[id]` - Revoke API key

**Security Features:**
- API keys stored as SHA-256 hashes
- Permission-based access control (usage:read, usage:write, *)
- Automatic expiration checking
- Last used timestamp tracking

**Integration:**
- Updated `/api/saas/usage` to require and verify API keys
- Created middleware in `src/utils/middleware/apiKeyAuth.ts`
- Verifies key ownership matches subscription's creator

- `customer.subscription.updated` - Handles plan changes, cancellations
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Marks as cancelled, sends notification
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Confirms payment, sends receipt
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Alerts user to payment issue

**Email Notifications:**
All events create EmailNotification records with:
- Type, subject, body, recipient
- Status tracking (pending, sent, failed)
- Metadata for context

**Database Schema:**
- Updated `WhiteLabelConfig` table:
  - Now links to `SaasCreator` instead of `User`

**Customization Options:**
- Brand name and colors (primary, secondary)
- Logo and favicon URLs
- Custom domain and subdomain
- Custom CSS for advanced styling
- Active/inactive toggle

---

### ✅ 5. Advanced Analytics (100% Complete - Backend)

**Database Schema:**
- New `AnalyticsSnapshot` table for caching metrics
  - Stores: period, revenue, subscriber counts, usage
  - Optimized for performance with indexes

**API Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/saas/analytics?period=monthly&creatorId={id}`
