# Stripe Account Profile Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the Stripe OAuth callback to build a comprehensive account profile immediately after connecting a Stripe account. This ensures users have a complete business profile pre-populated from their Stripe data, minimizing manual data entry during onboarding.

## What Changed

### File Modified
- `src/app/api/saas/stripe-connect/callback/route.ts`

### Key Improvements

1. **Removed Conditional Checks**: Previously, data was only populated if SaasCreator fields were empty. Now, Stripe data is always used as the source of truth after OAuth connection.

2. **Comprehensive Data Extraction**: Significantly expanded the data extracted from Stripe accounts.

## Data Now Extracted from Stripe

### Business Identity
- **Business Name**: Extracted from `business_profile.name`, falling back to `company.name` or individual name
- **Business Type**: Type of entity (individual, company, non_profit, government_entity)
- **Legal Entity Name**: Full legal company name from `company.name`
- **Business Description**: From `business_profile.product_description`
- **Website**: From `business_profile.url`

### Contact Information (stored in contactInfo JSON)
- **Email**: From `business_profile.support_email`, `email`, or `individual.email`
- **Phone**: From `business_profile.support_phone`, `company.phone`, or `individual.phone`
- **Support URL**: From `business_profile.support_url`

### Address Information
- **Company Address**: Formatted string from `business_profile.support_address`, `company.address`, or `individual.address`
  - Includes: line1, line2, city, state, postal_code, country

### Business Metadata
- **Country**: Account country code
- **Currency**: Default currency for the account
- **MCC (Merchant Category Code)**: Industry classification code
- **Tax ID**: Company tax ID or individual SSN last 4 digits

### Account Status & Capabilities
- **Charges Enabled**: Whether the account can accept charges
- **Payouts Enabled**: Whether the account can receive payouts

### Owner/Representative Information
- **Owner Name**: Full name from individual account details
- **Owner Date of Birth**: If available from individual account

### Financial/Payout Settings
- **Payout Schedule**: Interval (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Payout Delay**: Number of days delay for payouts
- **Bank Last 4**: Last 4 digits of bank account
- **Bank Name**: Name of the bank
- **Bank Account Type**: Type of bank account (checking, savings)

## Database Storage

### SaasCreator Fields Updated
- `businessName`: Primary business identifier
- `businessDescription`: What the company does
- `website`: Business website URL
- `companyAddress`: Formatted full address string
- `contactInfo`: JSON object containing all additional metadata

### ContactInfo JSON Structure
```json
{
  "email": "support@example.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "supportUrl": "https://support.example.com",
  "country": "US",
  "currency": "usd",
  "businessType": "company",
  "mcc": "5734",
  "chargesEnabled": true,
  "payoutsEnabled": true,
  "taxId": "12-3456789",
  "legalEntityName": "Example Corp",
  "ownerName": "John Doe",
  "ownerDob": {"year": 1980, "month": 5, "day": 15},
  "payoutSchedule": "daily",
  "payoutDelay": 2,
  "bankLast4": "4242",
  "bankName": "STRIPE TEST BANK",
  "bankAccountType": "checking"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Zero Manual Entry**: Users get a fully populated profile without typing anything
2. **Accurate Data**: Information comes directly from their verified Stripe account
3. **Complete Profile**: All necessary business information is captured in one step
4. **Flexible Fallbacks**: Multiple sources checked for each field to maximize data coverage
5. **Secure**: Sensitive data (full tax IDs, full bank account numbers) is not stored

## User Experience

After connecting their Stripe account via OAuth:
1. User is redirected back to onboarding
2. All business information is pre-populated from Stripe
3. User can review and make minor edits if needed
4. User clicks "Finish" to complete onboarding

This achieves the goal stated in the issue: "The goal is to pre populate all the account/business data from stripe so the user doesn't need to do anything more than click finish."

## Technical Notes

- Uses Stripe API version `2023-10-16`
- Authenticates with connected account using the access token from OAuth
- Calls `accounts.retrieve()` to get complete account details
- Stores all data immediately after OAuth token exchange
- Continues onboarding even if Stripe data fetch fails (graceful degradation)

## Future Enhancements

Potential additional data that could be extracted:
- Product catalog from Stripe (if any products already exist)
- Historical payment/revenue data for analytics
- Connected payment methods and capabilities
- Brand assets if stored in Stripe metadata
