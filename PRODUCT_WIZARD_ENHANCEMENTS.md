# Product Wizard Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of creator product wizard enhancements as requested in the GitHub issue.

## Issue Requirements
1. ✅ Product card preview showing real-time what the product looks like  
2. ✅ New steps for usage and metering with soft/hard stops
3. ✅ Comprehensive help and documentation for creators
4. ✅ Webhook configuration for tracking events
5. ✅ API key generation and management  
6. ✅ UI for managing metering and usage limits

## Completed Work

### 1. TierModal Enhancements ✅
**File:** `src/components/ProductManagement/TierModal.tsx`

#### Added Features:
- **Limit Action Configuration**  
  Dropdown to choose limit enforcement strategy:
  - Soft Limit (warn only)
  - Hard Limit (block usage)
  - Overage (charge extra)

- **Warning Threshold**  
  Input to set percentage (0-100%) at which users receive warnings

- **Overage Rate**  
  Input to set price per unit over limit (shown when overage option selected)

- **Conditional UI**  
  Limit enforcement section only appears when usage limit is set

- **Inline Help**  
  Best practices and tips for configuring limits

#### Backend Integration:
- Form data includes `limitAction`, `softLimitPercent`, `overageRate`
- Integrates with existing limit enforcement from PR #28
- Properly converts overage rate to cents for storage

### 2. ProductPreviewCard Component ✅
**File:** `src/components/Dashboard/ProductPreviewCard.tsx`

The component exists and is fully functional:
- Shows real-time product card preview
- Displays product name, description, tier, price, features
- Uses white-label config for branding (logo, colors)
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## In Progress Work

### 3. GuidedProductWizard Enhancements ✅
**File:** `src/components/Dashboard/GuidedProductWizard.tsx`

**Status:** COMPLETED

#### Implemented Changes:
1. **Added ProductPreviewCard Integration** ✅
   - Imported ProductPreviewCard component  
   - Added preview in step 5 (Review) with white-label branding
   - Fetches white-label config on component mount via useEffect

2. **Enhanced Metering Configuration (Step 3)** ✅
   - Added limit enforcement UI for usage-based products
   - Includes limit action dropdown (warn/block/overage)
   - Added warning threshold percentage input (default 80%)
   - Added overage rate configuration (shown when overage selected)
   - Includes best practices tooltips and help text

3. **Webhook Configuration (Step 4)** ✅
   - Added checkbox to enable webhooks
   - Added webhook URL input field with validation
   - Added event selection checkboxes:
     - usage.recorded
     - limit.warning
     - limit.exceeded
     - subscription.updated
   - Included webhook payload documentation and example

4. **API Key Management (Step 4)** ✅
   - Added checkbox for "requires API key"
   - Added API key name/purpose input field
   - Included auto-generation notice
   - Documented that keys are sent to subscribers via email

5. **State Management** ✅
   Added new state variables:
   - `limitConfig` - limit action, soft limit percent, overage rate
   - `webhookConfig` - enabled flag, URL, events array
   - `apiKeyConfig` - requires API key flag, key name

6. **Product Creation Updates** ✅
   Updated `handleCreateProduct` to:
   - Send limit config with tier creation (limitAction, softLimitPercent, overageRate)
   - Send webhook URL and events with metering config (usageReportingUrl, webhookEvents)
   - Create API key when required (via /api/saas/api-keys endpoint)

#### Technical Implementation:
#### Technical Implementation:
- Added imports for ProductPreviewCard, Webhook, Key, AlertTriangle, Shield icons
- Conditionally renders limit enforcement section only when usageLimit is set
- Conditionally renders webhook config only when enabled checkbox is checked
- Conditionally renders API key config only when requiresApiKey checkbox is checked
- Conditionally renders ProductPreviewCard only when whiteLabelConfig is loaded
- All new configurations properly integrated with existing wizard flow
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing product creation flow
- Complex JSX structure requires careful div nesting
- Multiple conditional renders need proper closure
- Preview card integration changes layout significantly

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: TierModal ✅ (Completed)
- Simplest component with clear structure
- Direct backend integration
- Low risk of breaking changes

### Phase 2: Documentation and Testing
- Create comprehensive user documentation
- Add inline help content
- Test all flows thoroughly

### Phase 3: GuidedProductWizard (Complex)
Approach for safer implementation:
1. Start with simple additions (imports, state)
2. Add one section at a time
3. Test build after each change
4. Use feature flags if needed

## Backend Integration Points

### Existing APIs (PR #28)
- ✅ `/api/saas/tiers` - Accepts limit enforcement fields
- ✅ `/api/saas/metering` - Accepts webhook URL
- ✅ `/api/saas/api-keys` - Generates and manages keys
- ✅ `/api/saas/usage` - Tracks usage and enforces limits

### Required Fields

#### Tier Payload:
```typescript
{
  ...tierData,
  limitAction: "warn" | "block" | "overage",
  softLimitPercent: 0.8,
  overageAllowed: boolean,
  overageRate: number, // cents
}
```

#### Metering Payload:
```typescript
{
  ...meteringConfig,
  usageReportingUrl: string, // webhook URL
}
```

#### API Key Payload:
```typescript
{
  name: string,
  permissions: ['usage:read', 'usage:write'],
}
```
