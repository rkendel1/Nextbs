# Platform Owner Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up a full platform owner with products and tiers configured for creator onboarding.

## Overview

The platform owner setup is essential for enabling creator onboarding. Creators need to see and select from active products with pricing tiers when they:
1. Visit the landing/pricing page
2. Go through the onboarding process
3. Subscribe to platform services

## Prerequisites

Before running the setup script, ensure you have:

1. **Database**: A PostgreSQL database configured
2. **Environment Variables**: Required variables set in `.env` file:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (optional but recommended)
   ```

## Setup Script

### Quick Start

Run the full platform owner setup script:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/setup-full-platform-owner.ts
```

### What It Does

The `setup-full-platform-owner.ts` script performs the following operations:

1. **Creates Platform Owner User**
   - Email: `platform@nextbs.com`
   - Role: `platform_owner`
   - Subscription Status: `FREE`

2. **Creates SaasCreator Profile**
   - Business Name: "Platform Business"
   - Onboarding: Completed (step 4)
   - Crawl Status: Completed

3. **Creates Three Active Products**:

   #### Starter Plan ($29/month)
   - Target: Small businesses and individuals
   - Features:
     - Up to 5 users
     - Basic support
     - 1GB storage
     - Core features access
     - Email support
   - Usage Limit: 100

   #### Professional Plan ($59/month)
   - Target: Growing businesses and teams
   - Features:
     - Up to 20 users
     - Priority support
     - 10GB storage
     - Advanced analytics
     - API access
     - Custom integrations
   - Usage Limit: 500

   #### Enterprise Plan ($99/month)
   - Target: Large organizations
   - Features:
     - Unlimited users
     - 24/7 dedicated support
     - 100GB storage
     - Advanced analytics & reporting
     - Custom integrations
     - SSO & advanced security
     - Dedicated account manager
     - SLA guarantee
   - Usage Limit: 10,000

4. **Stripe Integration** (if configured)
   - Creates Stripe products for each plan
   - Creates Stripe prices for each tier
   - Links Stripe IDs to database records

## Stripe Configuration

### With Stripe Configured

When `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set, the script will:
- Create Stripe products and prices
- Store `stripePriceId` in database
- Enable tiers to appear on the pricing page
- Allow creators to subscribe via Stripe

### Without Stripe

If Stripe is not configured:
- Products and tiers are still created in the database
- **WARNING**: Tiers without `stripePriceId` won't appear on the pricing page
- The API endpoint `/api/saas/tiers` filters out tiers without Stripe price IDs
- You'll need to run the script again after configuring Stripe

## Verifying Setup

After running the setup script, verify the configuration:

```bash
# Comprehensive setup verification
npm run verify:setup

# Check tiers in database (detailed)
npm run verify:tiers

# Check platform owner (basic)
npx tsx scripts/check-platform-owner.ts
```

### Verification Script Output

The `verify:setup` script checks:

1. ‚úÖ Platform owner user exists
2. ‚úÖ SaasCreator profile is complete
3. ‚úÖ Active products exist
4. ‚úÖ Products have Stripe integration
5. ‚úÖ Tiers have Stripe price IDs
6. ‚úÖ API endpoint will return valid data

**Example output:**
```

Creators can now onboard and view available products on the pricing page.
```

## How It Enables Creator Onboarding

### 1. Pricing Page Visibility

The pricing page at `/pricing` fetches tiers from `/api/saas/tiers`:

```typescript
// API returns only active tiers with Stripe price IDs
const platformOwner = await prisma.user.findFirst({
  where: { role: 'platform_owner' },
  include: {
    saasCreator: {
      include: {
        products: {
          where: { isActive: true },
          include: {
            tiers: {
              where: { isActive: true },
              orderBy: { sortOrder: 'asc' }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### 2. Creator Subscription Flow

1. Creator visits the landing page
2. Views available pricing tiers
3. Selects a plan
4. Completes Stripe checkout
5. Gains access to platform features

### 3. Onboarding Process

During creator onboarding (`/saas/onboarding`):
- Creators can select from available products
- Products are displayed with their tiers and pricing
- Subscription is created upon selection
- Creator profile is marked as onboarded

## Troubleshooting

### Tiers Not Showing on Pricing Page

**Issue**: Pricing page is empty or shows "No plans available"

**Solutions**:
1. Check if Stripe is configured:
   ```bash
   echo $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
   ```
2. Run the setup script with Stripe configured
3. Verify tiers have `stripePriceId`:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/verify-tiers.ts
   ```

### Products Already Exist

**Behavior**: Script detects existing products and:
- Skips product creation
- Updates missing Stripe products/prices
- Links existing records to Stripe

**Safe to Re-run**: The script is idempotent and can be run multiple times.

### Database Connection Issues

**Error**: `DATABASE_URL` not found

**Solution**: 
1. Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`
2. Set your database connection string
3. Run `npx prisma generate` to update client

## Related Scripts

- `scripts/setup-platform-owner.ts` - Basic setup (no Stripe)
- `scripts/setup-platform-complete.ts` - Setup with test data
- `scripts/verify-tiers.ts` - Verify tier configuration
- `scripts/check-platform-owner.ts` - Check platform owner status

## Manual Alternative

If you prefer to create products manually:

1. Create platform owner user with role `platform_owner`
2. Create SaasCreator profile linked to the user
3. Use the product wizard in the dashboard
4. Create tiers with Stripe integration
5. Ensure `isActive` is true for products and tiers

## API Reference

### GET /api/saas/tiers

Returns active tiers from platform owner's products.

**Response**:
```json
{
  "tiers": [
    {
      "id": "tier_123",
      "nickname": "Basic",
      "unit_amount": 2900,
      "offers": ["Up to 5 users", "Basic support", ...],
      "product": {
        "name": "Starter Plan",
        "description": "Perfect for small businesses..."
      },
      "isActive": true,
      "stripePriceId": "price_123..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Filtering**: Only returns tiers with:
- `isActive: true`
- `stripePriceId` is not null
- Product `isActive: true`

## Best Practices

1. **Run After Database Setup**: Execute this script after database migrations
2. **Configure Stripe First**: Set up Stripe before running to get full functionality
3. **Verify Results**: Always check the summary output
4. **Document Changes**: If you modify product/tier configs, update this guide
5. **Test Pricing Page**: Visit `/pricing` to verify tiers appear correctly

## Customization

To customize the products and tiers, edit the `PRODUCTS_CONFIG` array in `setup-full-platform-owner.ts`:

```typescript
const PRODUCTS_CONFIG: ProductConfig[] = [
  {
    name: 'Your Product Name',
    description: 'Your product description',
    tiers: [
      {
        name: 'Tier Name',
        description: 'Tier description',
        priceAmount: 4900, // $49 in cents
        billingPeriod: 'monthly',
        features: ['Feature 1', 'Feature 2'],
        usageLimit: 1000,
        sortOrder: 1
      }
    ]
  }
];
```
